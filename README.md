with human feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02155)

### Questions

- In the context of RLHF, how to calculate the $L_t^{V F}(\theta)$,
  - Like it’s a function of the PPO agent uses to predict how much
    reward it gets if generates the sequence?
- ~~Does the RL model and the SFT model use the same tokenizer? Yes~~
- ~~I don’t know how to returns the logit of the generation model~~

## Install

``` sh
pip install instruct_goose
```

### Resources

I used these resources to implement this

- Copied the
  [`load_yaml`](https://xrsrke.github.io/instructGOOSE/utils.html#load_yaml)
  function from https://github.com/Dahoas/reward-modeling
- Learned how to build a dataset to train reward model:
  https://wandb.ai/carperai/summarize_RLHF/reports/Implementing-RLHF-Learning-to-Summarize-with-trlX–VmlldzozMzAwODM2
- Learned how to add value head in PPO agent:
